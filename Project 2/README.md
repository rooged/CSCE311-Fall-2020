# Project 2 - First Come First Serve CPU Scheduler

## How To Use:
- I can't provie the simulator to run the code because it's copyrighted code. So testing is not possible.

## Result
The program is a CPU scheduler using the First Come First Serve scheduler algorithm.
Completed code compiled and runs through the simulator to sucessful completion.
