# Project 3 - Deadlock Avoidance Algorithm

## How To Use:
- I can't provide the simulator to run the code because it's copyrighted code. So testing is not possible.

## Result
The program is a CPU scheduler that includes deadlock avoidance to prevent thread deadlock.
Completed code compiled and runs through the simulator to sucessful completion.
